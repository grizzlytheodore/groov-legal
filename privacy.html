  <h3>2.3 Cached Album & Video Data</h3>

  <h3>2.4 Scan Metrics & Debug Logs</h3>
  <div class="box">
    <p>
      Groov maintains internal scan metrics for reliability and debugging. These logs may include scan timestamps, success/failure indicators, API error details, cache hit flags, response times, and <strong>raw AI response output</strong> used to identify records.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>2.5 Photos You Upload</h3>

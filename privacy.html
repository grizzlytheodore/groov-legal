  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: December 8, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>StudioTCHoldings LLC</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Groov mobile application and related services (collectively, the “Service”).
  </p>
  <p>
    By using Groov, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
  <p>Depending on how you use the Service, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information (optional):</strong> If the app supports account creation or sign-in, we may collect your email address and basic profile details.</li>
    <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> When you contact us at <a href="mailto:support@groovvinyl.com">support@groovvinyl.com</a>, we collect the information you provide (email, message content, attachments).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <p>When you use the Service, we may automatically collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Interactions with the app (e.g., scans, searches, viewed albums, playback actions), crash logs, and basic diagnostic information.</li>
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, app version, language, and approximate region (not precise GPS location).</li>
    <li><strong>Log data:</strong> IP address (or a truncated/hashed form), timestamps, and technical event logs for security and debugging.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.3 Images and Scan Content</h3>
  <p>
    Groov allows you to capture or upload photos of vinyl covers or labels so the app can identify records and retrieve information. These images may be sent to our backend services and third-party AI services strictly to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform image recognition and identify the record or track.</li>
    <li>Look up metadata (artist, album, track list, etc.) from third-party services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not use these images to identify you personally, and we do not sell or license these images for advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service.</li>
    <li>Identify vinyl records and fetch metadata, prices, and related information.</li>
    <li>Search for and play music-related videos using YouTube Data API Services.</li>
    <li>Improve and personalize the user experience.</li>
    <li>Monitor usage, diagnose problems, and enhance performance and security.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you, including responding to support requests.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

  <p>
    Groov relies on third-party services to provide core functionality, such as record identification, metadata, and video playback. These services may process data in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1 YouTube API Services</h3>
  <p>
    Groov uses <strong>YouTube Data API Services</strong> to search for and play music-related videos (for example, full albums or individual tracks). The app may display YouTube video titles, thumbnails, channels, and playback within the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube Terms of Service</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> use YouTube OAuth to access your personal YouTube account, and we do <strong>not</strong> store your YouTube account credentials, subscriptions, playlists, or viewing history. We only interact with publicly available video data returned by YouTube Data API Services based on search queries generated in the app.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Other Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>Depending on the current version of the app, we may use services such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Metadata providers</strong> (e.g., Discogs or similar APIs) to retrieve album, artist, and track data.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud infrastructure and databases</strong> to securely store cached metadata and your preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and crash reporting tools</strong> to help us understand app performance and stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These third-party services are only allowed to use your data as necessary to perform services on our behalf and are obligated to protect it.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    Groov is primarily a mobile application and does not rely on traditional web cookies within the app itself. If you visit our website or hosted documentation, we may use basic analytics or logging technologies similar to most websites. Any such usage will be limited to understanding aggregate traffic and service health.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Legal Bases (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, we process your personal data where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is necessary to provide the Service you request (performance of a contract).</li>
    <li>It is necessary for our legitimate interests, such as improving the Service, preventing fraud, and protecting the security of our systems.</li>
    <li>We have your consent, where required by law.</li>
    <li>We must comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. How We Share Information</h2>
  <p>We may share information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With service providers that host, maintain, or support the Service (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting).</li>
    <li>With third-party APIs (e.g., YouTube, metadata providers) as necessary to fulfill search and playback features.</li>
    <li>If required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
    <li>To enforce our Terms of Service, protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or the public.</li>
    <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, subject to appropriate safeguards.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information to third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Service, resolve disputes, and comply with our legal obligations. Cache data such as album metadata, thumbnails, and matched YouTube video IDs may be stored to improve performance and reduce repeated API calls.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.
  </p>

  <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    We may process and store information on servers located in countries other than your country of residence. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have data protection rules different from those of your country.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The right to access and receive a copy of your data.</li>
    <li>The right to correct inaccurate data.</li>
    <li>The right to delete certain data.</li>
    <li>The right to object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
    <li>The right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To exercise any of these rights (where applicable), please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@groovvinyl.com">support@groovvinyl.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before responding.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. If changes are material, we may provide additional notice (such as within the app or via email, where appropriate).
  </p>
  <p>
    Your continued use of the Service after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
  </p>
